/*
Printing a grid. Write a program that prints the following grid to play tic-tac-toe.
+--+--+--+
|  |  |  |
+--+--+--+
|  |  |  |
+--+--+--+
|  |  |  |
+--+--+--+
Of course, you could simply write seven statements of the form
System.out.println("+--+--+--+");
You should do it the smart way, though. Declare string variables to hold two kinds
of patterns: a comb-shaped pattern and the bottom line. Print the comb three times
and the bottom line once.
